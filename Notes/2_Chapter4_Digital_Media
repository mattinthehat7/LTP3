Images and Image Links

    <img src="/images/logo.jpg /> --> 

    <img src="/images/logo.jpg" alt="LearToProgram Logo" /> 

    *NOTE THE SHORTCUT CLOSE (final / at the end)

    *IMAGES WILL BE IN DIFFERENT FOLDER --> create path to images folder
    *attributes ==> alt="learntoprogram logo" --> can read alt text to visually impaired, also helps search engines, gives them a better idea of the content on the page
    *Images are inline so they are treated like they are text --> use a BREAK to separate the images

    Image links --> same process as text

    FULL EXAMPLE
        <p><a href="https://www.trumbull-ct.gov/"><img src="images/Trumbull.jpg" alt="Trumbull, CT /></a><br/>Trumbull, CT</p>

        *can move the </a> later to include the text

Image and Image Sizes

    *When selecting a width in html you can directly set the width in pixels or the percentage of the width of the parent element or the screen

    <img src="lake.jpg" width="100%" alt="Boat on a lake"/>

Sizing Images Responsively

    ADD CSS STYLING (Will set image to be 100% size regardless of browser size)
    *PUT THIS STYLE CSS IN HEAD
    
    <style> 
        img {
            width: 100%;
            height: auto;
        }
    </style>
    
    <img src="images/nature.jpg" alt="Nature Photo" />
    
    ^^ above is for large image 
    *for a smaller image do a MAX WIDTH FEATURE --> say 25%
    
    HTML 5 Has Picture element --> can select images based on the screen width
    
    <body>
        <picture>
            <source srcset="images/trees.jpg" media="(max-width:400px)">
            *this will only be shown on screen that are 400px or less
            *will display next one if criteria not met
            <source srcset="images/nature.jpg">
            <img src="images/nature.jpg"> * THIS IS TRADITIONAL FOR FALLBACK
            
            *not used in all browsers yet
            
Audio Files
    <audio controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay"> (controls gives you the browswers audio player) 
        <source src="Rhapsody.mp3" /> //source = tag, src = attribute
    </audio>
    
    Don't use AUTOPLAY because it's annoying to the user
