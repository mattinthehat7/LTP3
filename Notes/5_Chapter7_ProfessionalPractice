Commenting your Code
    Comments are for documentation
    
    <!--
    
    These are the comment tags - note to self or other developers - or a note to do something later
    
    -->
    
    Good coding practice indicates that you have comments in your code
    
    Can use them to comment out a part of the code that we don't want to show -- can be useful for debugging
    
Meta Tags
    
    Where Google and other search engines get information they use about your page
    
    No visible effect on the output of the browser -- used to index the page
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Meta Tags</title>
            <meta name="description" content="HTML5 Specialists work in professional development environments. Become an HTML5 expert and get certified!" />
            <meta name="author" content="Mark Lassoff" />
            
            <!-- keywords are not used very much anymore -->
            <meta name="keywords" content="html5, lessons, tutorial" />
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>

    </html>
    
    GOOGLE has a page that will show you what meta tags it uses to crawl websites -- meta tags that google understands
    
Inserting External Javascript Code
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Javascript Insert</title>
            <script>
                <!-- this is an alert when the page loads in between script tags; the script tag tells the browser to use javascript -->
                window.onload = function()
                {
                alert("Hello! Greetings");
                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    <html>
    
    
Inserting an external library to make mobile optimization called JQUERY
        
        You can do externally hosted copy and paste -- you will see script source
        Copy and paste all three from jquery mobile .com
        These are javascript libraries and hosted css -- downside is that app must be on the internet to work
        
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css" />
        <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
        <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script>
