Commenting your Code
    Comments are for documentation
    
    <!--
    
    These are the comment tags - note to self or other developers - or a note to do something later
    
    -->
    
    Good coding practice indicates that you have comments in your code
    
    Can use them to comment out a part of the code that we don't want to show -- can be useful for debugging
    
Meta Tags
    
    Where Google and other search engines get information they use about your page
    
    No visible effect on the output of the browser -- used to index the page
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Meta Tags</title>
            <meta name="description" content="HTML5 Specialists work in professional development environments. Become an HTML5 expert and get certified!" />
            <meta name="author" content="Mark Lassoff" />
            
            <!-- keywords are not used very much anymore -->
            <meta name="keywords" content="html5, lessons, tutorial" />
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>

    </html>
    
    GOOGLE has a page that will show you what meta tags it uses to crawl websites -- meta tags that google understands
