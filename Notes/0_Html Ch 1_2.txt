Some notes

Standard Format
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title> TITLE </head>
        </head>
        <body>
        
        </body>
    </html>

Break Tags
    <br/>
    
Paragraph Tags
    <p>

Preformatted Text
    Where you want the text to appear just like it does in the code
    Use the <pre> </pre> tags
    Isn't used much anymore -- gives monospaced font (each text gives same amount of space)
    
If you want to create multiple spaces you can use a non-breaking space
    &nbsp; will create a space everytime you put one there
    
Heading Tags (can have six levels with html5)
    h1 = most important
    -->
    h6
    
Lists
    Ordered Lists (numbers)
        <ol> (ordered list)
            <li> (list item)
    
    Unordered Lists (bulleted)
        <ul> unordered lists
            <li> list item tag
            
    Unordered Lists have type attributes <ul type="square"> -- changes icon before list
        i. square, circle, disc
        
    Ordered lists have type attributes <ol type="">
        A, a, I, i, start
        
*MORE THAN ONE ATTRIBUTE - JUST ADD A SPACE
    <ol type="A" start="13">
    
Quotations and Citations
    <blockquote> -- taking content from another source
    --offsets from other text
    -- inside blockquote use <cite> tag
    
Text Formatting
    <em> = emphasis 
    <strong> = stronger than the text around it
    em vs. strong = emphasis = italics, strong = bold
    
    There is bold tag = <b>
    There is italics tag = <i>
    They aren't used anymore!
    
    Highlight or mark
    <mark> = highlight
    <del> = delete = strikethrough text
    <ins> = insert = underline
    <sub> = subscript tag
    <sup> = superscript
    
Computer Code
    <code> = default the code tag displays the output in a monospaced font to look like computer code, can't put in just code --> if you want to add p tags it still processes the tags and doesn't display them as you want
    --> use character entities --> codes that represent the greater than and less than sign
    
    &lt; = less than sign
    &gt; = greater than sign
    
    so to show <code><p> would be &lt;p&gt;Hellow World &lt;/p&gt;</code>
    
Containers
    <div> (div is an element block-line (which is equivalent to having a line-break before and after it))
    <span> (inline usually used for a small chunk of html inside a line (such as inside a paragraph))
    --> new
    <article> <aside> <details> <figure> <figcaption> <header> <footer> <main> <nav> <section> <summary> <mark> <output> <menu> <progress> <meter>
    --> purpose of html5 is to better define
