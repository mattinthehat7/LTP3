Target Attribute

    Target where the resulting link will appear for the user -- be careful of pop-up blockers
    <a target="_blank" href="LINK">
        --> load in a new window or tab
    
    target="_blank" --> new window
    target="_self" --> load in same window (this is the default)
    
    also some features that work with frames --> usually not used except for iframes --> don't work well than mobile
    
    may see parent or top
        will want to change to blank or self
        Top will load it into full window and get rid of the frames, bust frames that are there
        
Anchors to navigate long pages (sometimes called bookmarks) - pages with sections --> create "name anchors"
    
    Step 1 = make a book mark
    
    <a name="give a name"></a> (anchor tag with name attribute)
    *don't want anything in between the tags because then it will make a link
    
    Step2 = make the links that people will use
        --> top or bottom of page add links with text that will create some links to the sections
        
        <a href="#use_anchor_name">LINK TEXT</a>
