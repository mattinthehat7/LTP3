Respsonsive Headers

    Most mobile browsers default to a full-width browser window (960px) -- To avoid that problem we use a viewport metatag
    
    THE VIEWPORT is the visible space in the visible space in the browser window through which you can see the content
    
    <head>
        <title> VIEWPORT </title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" /> 
        
        <!-- ABOVE PREVENTS USER FROM PINCHING THE PAGE -->
