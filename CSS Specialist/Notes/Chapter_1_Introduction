Hello World Example
    Place in between <style> </style> in the head <!-- see Ch_1 Document -->
    
CSS Intro/tools
    CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    Recommended using brackets.io
    
CSS Format
    Style goes in the head
    
    <style>
        
        <!-- CSS rules: Selector, property, value -->
        <!-- Selector tells you which rules you are going to modify (h1)
        then add {} -- inside curly brackets are the rules, property (background color) value (green) -->
        
        h1 {
            background-color: green;
            color: white;
        }
        
        p {
            color: pink;
        }
        
    </style>
    
Colors in CSS
    Three main ways to represent colors in CSS
    <!-- within the style tags is called internal linking -->
    
    <style>
    
    h1 {
        <!-- examples of three ways 1. name of color 2. rbg 3. hexidecimal (go from 0-9 and then from a - f -- so f is the highest, 0 is the lowest - 000000 is black and ffffff is white, ff0000 is full red) -->
        
        background-color: crimson;
        
        background-color: rgb(255,0,0); <!-- 0,0,0 = black 255 is the highest value can hover over color with brackets to see preview of color-->
        
        background-color: #8f00ff
    }
    
    </style>
    
Comments in CSS
    HTML COMMENT
        <!-- COMMENT EXAMPLE -->
        Won't show up anywhere in a browser will only see if they go into the source code and look for it
        
    CSS COMMENT
        Within the style section
        /* COMMENT EXAMPLE */
        
    Another use of comments is to disable a bit of code temporarily - useful for debugging
    
Complex Selectors
    
    Multiple Selectors 
        Example 1

        <style>

        h1 {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }

        p {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }

        </style>

        Example 2: Multiple Selectors

        h1, p {
            background-color: lightblue;
        }
        
    Ancestor-Descendent Relationship in HTML and CSS
        This is the tag heirarchy is HTML
        
        <style>
        
            /* all paragraph tags that are a descendent of the unordered list tag get the following rule */
            
            ul p {
                background-color: yellow;
            }
        
        </style>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Paragraph 1</p></li>
            <li><p>Paragraph 2</p></li>
            <li><p>Paragraph 3</p></li>
            <li><a>Anchor</a></li>
        </ul>
        
    Parent-Child Relationship
        
        /* want a tag to be purple but don't want any other a tags to be changed */
        /* all a tags that happen to be a child of a parent p tag will be purple */
        
        p>a {
            background-color: purple;
        }
        
        
        <p>Here is a link to my favorite search engine: <a href="https://google.com>GOOGLE</a></p>
        
        /* The a tag is the child of the parent p tag - can also describe as ancestor and descendent but parent child relationship is more specific because it only refers to 1 DEGREE OF SEPARATION */
        
    ID and Class Selectors
        
        Class Selectors are used to create custom styles that you may want to apply to multiple elements on the page
        
            Example:

            Apply to all headers

            <style>

            /* starting with a period (.) represents a class */

            .headerstyle {
                background-color: lightgreen;
            }

            .headertextcolor {
                color: white;
            }

            </style>

            <h1 class="headerstyle"> TEXT </h1>
            <h3 class="headerstyle"> TEXT </h1>
            <p class="headerstyle"> TEXT </p>

            Can apply the class you create to as many as you want and can apply multiple classes to one element by using a space between classes, for example:

            <p class="headerstyle headertextcolor"> TEXT </p>
        
        ID Selectors 3 differences: 
            i) are only paired to one specific element 
            ii) each element can only have one ID selector, can only apply one id selector per element 
            iii) have higher priority than class selectors, so if there is a conflict the id selector will win
            
            Use a pound sign for an ID Selector
            
            <style>
            
            #mostimportantinfo {
                background-color: lightpink;
                text-color: darkred;
            }
            
            </style>
            
            <h1 id="mostimportantinfo"> TEXT </h1>
            
3 Methods of Linking CSS
    
    1. External CSS
        Create external css file - must add .css at the end of the file to tell the computer that it is a css file
        
        In HTML header add a link tag (link is tag, href is a attribute)
        
        /* Note: Link tags don't have a closure slash */
        
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="mycss.css">
    
    2. Internally Linked CSS
        
        /* good when you have a website with many pages and you just want to have specific CSS on one page */
    
        Style tags in the header
            <style>
                h1 {
                    background-color: red;
                }
            </style>
    
    3. Inline CSS linking - apply styles and CSS rules to one specific element on the page
    
    <ol>
        <li>Green</li>
        <!--can do multiple styles by using a space after the semi-colon-->
        <li style="background-color:blue; color:white;">Organge</li>
    </ol>
    
CSS3 New Features
    CSS website is www.w3.org --> the world wide web consortium --> large group that comes up with recommendations that web developers should follow so websites can be standardized and viewable
