CSS Intro/tools

    Recommended using brackets.io
    
CSS Format
    Style goes in the head
    
    <style>
        
        <!-- CSS rules: Selector, property, value -->
        <!-- Selector tells you which rules you are going to modify (h1)
        then add {} -- inside curly brackets are the rules, property (background color) value (green) -->
        
        h1 {
            background-color: green;
            color: white;
        }
        
        p {
            color: pink;
        }

Colors in CSS
    Three main ways to represent colors in CSS
    <!-- within the style tags is called internal linking -->
    
    <style>
    
    h1 {
        <!-- examples of three ways 1. name of color 2. rbg 3. hexidecimal (go from 0-9 and then from a - f -- so f is the highest, 0 is the lowest - 000000 is black and ffffff is white, ff0000 is full red) -->
        
        background-color: crimson;
        
        background-color: rgb(255,0,0); <!-- 0,0,0 = black 255 is the highest value can hover over color with brackets to see preview of color-->
        
        background-color: #8f00ff
    }
    
    </style>
    
Comments in CSS
    HTML COMMENT
        <!-- COMMENT EXAMPLE -->
        Won't show up anywhere in a browser will only see if they go into the source code and look for it
        
    CSS COMMENT
        Within the style section
        /* COMMENT EXAMPLE */
        
    Another use of comments is to disable a bit of code temporarily - useful for debugging
